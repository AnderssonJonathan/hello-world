# Jonathan Andersson
**Born and raised in Sk√•ne.** *After graduating from school when I was 18 I started university studies to become a interaction designer. Dropped out after one year and instead I took some years of working at different companies. During these year I did some travelling such as New Zealand.* 

*When I had enough of working and travelling I moved to Gothenburg to becoming a teacher and after the graduation I started my teaching career there as well. Shortly after that I moved together with the love of my life after 5 years of our distance realtionship. Because we both like surfing and she also wanted som westcoast vibes we ended up in Varberg.* **I am now 30 and have taken a break from teaching because I want to try webbdeveloping.**
